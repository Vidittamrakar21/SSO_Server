<br>

<br>

## Description:
This repository contains a custom-built Single Sign-On (SSO) system using TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, React, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Firebase Authentication. The SSO system allows users to sign in once and gain access to multiple applications without the need to sign in again. It leverages secure authentication mechanisms, including JWT for token generation and Firebase for Google authentication. User credentials are securely stored in a MongoDB database.

<li>Token-based Authentication: Implements JWT for token-based authentication, ensuring secure access to applications.</li>
<li>Firebase Authentication: Utilizes Firebase Authentication for seamless Google authentication integration.</li>
<li>Session Management: Maintains user sessions to facilitate seamless navigation across multiple applications.</li>
<li>React Frontend: Utilizes React for building a  frontend interface.</li>
